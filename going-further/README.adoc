== Going Further

=== Uno a Uno

- use A and B for second player controls instead of AI.

Add a two-player mode. Instead of controlling it with the bad AI, make the A and B buttons provide the second player for HOURS of fun time.

=== Spring loaded

- Add a spring loaded feature the paddles, so that the player can add an extra oomph to the ball if they time their strike just right.

=== Power-ups?

Create a randomly appearing item that, when collided with the ball, boosts the speed of the game, or slows the opponent, or something else awesome.
