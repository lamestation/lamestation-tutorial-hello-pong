== Restructured

In the _SNAKE_ tutorial, we did the entire game inside of one main function. That's fine for short games, but it becomes more and more problematic the longer your game gets.

This time around, we're going to organize our game in a way that will be much more intuitive. By splitting our one big function into lots of smaller ones, it'll be easier to organize our thoughts and understand the logic of our game as we expand it.

Which is... AWESOME!

=== Instructions

We'll start out with the LameStation Basic Template.

==== If a Pong Ball's in a Forest...

Now, before we add graphics and start building out our game, let's take a moment to think about the _defining essence_ of our game.

This is a pong game, so what does a pong game need?

// picture of ping pong table would be nice.

- A table
- A ball
- Two paddles
- A score board

That's what a pong game _has_, but what about gameplay? What _happens_ in the game?

- There's a field; it just sits there
- Either player can move a paddle up or down
- A ball bounces around the screen
  - If it hits a paddle, it bounces back the other way
  - If it goes the past paddle, the other player scores a point, and the field resets
- First one to 9 points wins, and the game starts over
- The opponent might be a computer

That's pretty much it. That's everything that happens in our entire game, and that gives us an idea of how we should organize it.

==== Loop de loop

First and foremost, everything that happens in our game needs to happen in a loop. Loops are the magic that makes the world go round.

== The Playing Field

In this section, we're going to lay the groundwork for our pong game by adding the basic graphics and laying them out on the screen.

=== Instructions




==== A Ball

Add the graphics for the ball. A giant white square for consistency, but you can make the ball whatever you want it to be.

You need to draw the paddles twice, once on each side of the screen.

==== A Table

I think it's kind of a misnomer that it's called pong, because this game really plays more like an air hockey machine than a ping pong table.

// picture of air hockey machine from above.

But oh, well, history is history, and I guess it's kind of like ping pong, if you were playing in a room the size of the table...

Anyway, let's draw our net: how about a dotted line down the middle?

===== Finding Your Center

We could create a single graphic for the entire net, but that would be incredibly wasteful. Instead, we will add one little piece of the net that we will use to stamp the whole net.

// diagram of how stamping works

Let's put all the graphics on the screen. Obviously, they need to be in the middle of the screen, but what we have now does not look good.

Two things:

- The ball and paddles are already white, so let's make the net gray. A gray pixel is `%%3` on LameStation.
- The ball and paddles are on top of the table, so the net must be drawn first.

We'll add the graphics for the center line. It's just a tiny gray smudge.

Then we add our first variable `i` for array indexing.

We'll draw that little spot on the screen 8 times, for a dotted line 64 pixels long.
